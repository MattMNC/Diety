# Diety
Diety is my first curricular project.  

Diety is a full stack project composed by:  
-Frontend: React + TailwindCSS  
-Backend: C# - ASP .NET 6.0 - Entity Framework  
-Database: MS SQL Server  
  
This is an exercise to demonstrate my current level of coding to recruiters, despite this I learned many things working on this project and i'm really satisfied with it.  
  
Diety is an app that allows users to keep track of their diet. users can add foods, create meals and create weekly routines containing those meals, all while keeping track of nutritional values.  
  
I found this case challenging and useful to:  
-develop a database model with various types of entities, keys and relationships  
-develop API controllers that handle all crud operations  
-develop a functional and responsive UI in React
